                    "Welcome to my food blog! My name is<b> Rehab Khaleel</b>, and I'm a self-proclaimed foodie with a
                    passion for cooking and eating. I'm also a bit of a goofball, so I like to add a little humor to my
                    recipes.

                    I believe that food should be fun and delicious. I don't believe in following strict diets or
                    depriving
                    yourself of your favorite foods. I think it's okay to indulge every once in a while, as long as you
                    do
                    it in moderation.
                    <br><br>

                    <img src="./images/heart.png" alt="">
                    In fact, I think that food is even better when it's funny. There's nothing like a good laugh to make
                    a
                    meal even more enjoyable. So if you're looking for recipes that are both tasty and funny, then
                    you've
                    come to the right place.

                    I'm not a professional chef, but I've been cooking for as long as I can remember. I started out by
                    helping my mom in the kitchen, and I quickly developed a love for all things food. I love
                    experimenting
                    with new recipes, and I'm always looking for ways to make my food more creative and fun.

                    I also love to share my love of food with others. I'm always hosting potlucks and dinner parties,
                    and I
                    love to see the look on people's faces when they try one of my recipes for the first time.
